# EfficientNetB7 Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and usage of the EfficientNetB7 model using TensorFlow and Keras.
EfficientNetB7 is part of the EfficientNet family, known for its high performance on image classification tasks with an efficient and scalable architecture.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nghuyentrangvt98/efficient_net_B7.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd efficient_net_B7
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook EfficientnetB7.ipynb
```

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries installed:

1. efficientnet
2. matplotlib
3. pillow
4. seaborn
5. plotly
6. tensorflow
7. tqdm

### You can install all required packages by running the first code block in the notebook.

## Setup Instructions

1. Import necessary packages: Ensure all required libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook.
2. Configure `master_path`: Update `master_path` in 3rd code block to point to the directory containing your input data.

## Usage

1. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the model, preprocess images, and make predictions.
2. Visualize results with the provided plotting utilities to see the modelâ€™s performance.
3. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different configurations to suit your needs.
